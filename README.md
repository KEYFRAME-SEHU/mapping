# Mapping Immersive Worlds (WebXR, Apps, VR, open worlds, and more.)

**Mapping Immersive Worlds** is a project of [VirtualWorlds.Museum](https://VirtualWorlds.Museum) / Keyframe-Entertainment. 
~ With support from OMI Group, Neurafile, New World Notes, and MetaTr@versal.

VirtualWorlds.Museum is inviting world builders to help build out museum branded worlds. As we venture forward in building museum hubs, our goal is to explore the virtual worlds ecosystem and share those findings with the XR community. 

**World Builders wanting to collaborate, please reach out to natacha(at)virtualworlds.museum for more details.**
